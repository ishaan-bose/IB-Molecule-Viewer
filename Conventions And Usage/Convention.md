Before I define the function of this vector, I want us to be on the same page. <br>
When I say orbital, I mean that the orbital exists somewhere in space near the atom(s) and it has a certain size.<br>
Atomic Orbitals In reality extend out till infinity and there is technically a really astronomically small chance to<br>
to find an electron of an atom at another galaxy, but it **IS** theoretically possible. <br>

So What do I mean when I say "size of an orbital"? What I mean is the size of the probability field that has<br>
a 99% chance of finding an electron inside. That is what actually matters in all chemical reactions.<br>
